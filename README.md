# Credit Risk Modeling Projects

This repository collects my projects and exercises on **credit risk modeling**.  
It is meant as a study and experimentation space to practice and explore different approaches used in quantitative credit risk.

## Contents

- **CDO implied correlation**  
  Work on collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and estimation of implied correlation.  

- **CDS pricing**  
  Implementations and tests of credit default swap (CDS) pricing techniques.  

- **Credit Portfolio Value Distribution**  
  Simulation and analysis of portfolio loss/value distributions, including Monte Carlo methods.  

- **CRHW3 Data**  
  Input datasets and raw data used in the above projects.  

## Purpose

The goal is to build intuition and hands-on skills in:
- Understanding credit derivatives (CDS, CDOs)  
- Portfolio credit risk modeling and distribution estimation  
- Applying quantitative methods to credit-related financial instruments  

> âš¡ This repo is mainly for **learning, practice, and exploration**. It may contain drafts, simplified models, or work-in-progress notebooks.
